    <h1>The Pursuit of Programming</h1>

    <p>In this world of constant new updates, it comes as no surprise that society is demanding the progression of technology. Particularly now, during this pandemic, people are <strong>heavily</strong> relying on technology in everyday tasks while trying to stay safe at home. This <strong>resonates</strong> deeply with me, as I, like many others nationwide, have lost my job due to the pandemic. <br> Through this all, I remain <span class="fun">optimistic</span> and see both new <span class="fun">opportunities</span> and the potential for <span class="fun">growth</span>. It has given me the <strong>tenacity</strong> to focus on what I feel passionately about, and that is <strong>helping others</strong>. <br> Growing up bilingual gave me the insight on how to approach learning different languages - even programming ones. The exposure to different cultures in my travels has allowed me the opportunity to be <span class="fun">open-minded</span> and <strong>embrace</strong> different approaches to all ideas. All this combined is a <strong>force</strong> that I plan to foster within myself, to be the best version of myself, and to use to help others. <strong>Programming will allow me to work past my limitations, and help others along the way.</strong></p>
