    <h2>What's My Name Again?</h2>
    <p>My name Agata is a traditional <em>Polish</em> name, it is sometimes mispronounced as <em>Agatha</em>, which is ok.<br> If you're not <em>vibing</em> with the name Agata, that's ok! You can call me by my nickname <strong>Carmen</strong>! <br>I am <strong>adventurous</strong> and <strong>adaptable</strong>, which reminded my friends of the <em>elusive</em> main character of the video game, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmen_Sandiego"><em>Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego</em></a>, and hence the nickname was born. <br><strong>I am not an international thief as Carmen is in the game but, I do make it my mission to acquire precious knowledge and experience wherever I go.</strong></p>
