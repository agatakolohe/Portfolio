You must click on the "Carmen Sandiego" image to enter the main page. Included in the main page: about me, education and job experience sections, links to pages about my background, hobbies and travels, and a link to a page about why I decided to take a class on programming containing links to other GitHub Pages and repositories of projects I have created thus far in the program.
