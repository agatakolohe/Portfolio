# Agata's Portfolio Webpage

#### HTML, CSS and Git Independent Project for Epicodus Intro to Programming, 08-27-2020

#### By Agata Kolodziej

## Description

First independent project for Epicodus Intro to Programming. It is a portfolio webpage about me. It demonstrates what I have learned the first few weeks of class using HTML and CSS. I also added a few stylings from Bootstrap. Included: an about me section, links to supplemental pages about my background, hobbies and travels, an education and job experience section, and a link to a page about why I decided to take a class on programming containing links to other GitHub Pages and repositories of projects I have created thus far in the class. Note: There is a little Carmen Sandiego image on the bottom right hand corner in the "Poland, Hawaii and Washington" pages that will link you back to the main page.
