# Git, HTML and CSS Independent Project

### Portfolio Webpage Using HTML and CSS

#### By Agata Kolodziej

## Description

First independent project for Epicodus Intro to Programming. It is a portfolio webpage about me demonstrating what I have learned the first few weeks of class using HTML and CSS. I also added a few stylings from Bootstrap. Included: an about me section with links to supplemental pages about my background, hobbies and travels, an education and job experience section, and link to a page about why I decided to take a class on programming with links to other GitHub Pages and repositories of projects I have created thus far in the class. There is a little Carmen Sandiego image at the bottom right hand corner in the "Poland, Hawaii and Washington" pages that links you back to the main page.
