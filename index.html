    <p class="fun">But really it's <em>Carmen</em></p>
  <h2>What's my Name Again?</h2>
    <p>My name Agata is a traditional Polish name. It is usually mispronounced as <em>Agatha</em> by most people. To my friends, it seemed like an old-fashioned name that did not suit who I am. I am adventurous and adapatble, which reminded my friends of the elusive main character of the video game, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmen_Sandiego"><em>Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego</em></a>. After moving to Hawaii with a friend for college, she would only introduced me as <en>Carmen</en>. Besides the folks that sign my paychecks, most people on Oahu do not know my real name! Although I am not a thief like Carmen is in the game, I do make it my mission to acquire precious knowledge and experience wherever I go.</p>

  <h2>Why Programming? </h2>
    <p>In this world of constant new updates, it comes as no surprise that society is demanding the progression of technology. Particularly now, during this pandemic, people are heavily relying on technology in everyday tasks while trying to stay safe at home. This resonates deeply with me, as I, like many others nationwide, have lost my job due to the pandemic. Through this all, I remain optimistic and see both new opportunities and the potential for growth. It has given me the tenacity to focus on what I feel passionately about, and that is helping others. Growing up bilingual gave me the insight on how to approach learning different languages - even programming ones. The exposure to different cultures in my travels has allowed me the opportunity to be open-minded and embrace different approaches to all ideas. All this combined is a force that I plan to forster within myself, to be the best version of myself, and to use to help others. Programming will allow me to move past my limitations, and help others along the way.</p>
