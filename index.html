    <h2>What's My Name Again?</h2>
      <p>My name Agata is a traditional Polish name. It is usually mispronounced as <em>Agatha</em> by most people. To my friends, it seemed like an old-fashioned name that did not suit who I am. I am adventurous and adaptable, which reminded my friends of the elusive main character of the video game, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmen_Sandiego"><em>Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego</em></a>. Besides the folks that sign my paychecks, most people on Oahu do not know my real name! <strong>Although I am not a thief as Carmen is in the game, I do make it my mission to acquire precious knowledge and experience wherever I go.</strong></p>
