    <h2>Settle in Seattle</h2>
      <p>After much thought and travel, I decided to move away from my beloved island of Oahu and give the <em>Mainland</em> a try. My first stop was Houston, Texas and it deemed to be too <strong>crowded</strong> and <strong>humid</strong> for me. The next stop was northern Colorado. It was the complete opposite of my experience in Houston. I lived on a horse ranch in a remote town, and it was <strong>cold</strong> and <strong>dry</strong>. Although there were many opportunities to enjoy two of my favorite hobbies, hiking and drinking local craft beer, my body made me <em>very</em> aware that it did not want to acclimate to Colorado's high altitude and dry climate. In result, I left Colorado and drove to <strong>Seattle</strong>.</p>

    <h3>Reasons for Relocation:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Career Change</strong>. My goal is to find a career in the technology industry. Seattle has been said to be <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2018/seattle-nations-fastest-growing-tech-hub-study-says-bay-area-engineering-centers-continue-expand/#:~:text=The%20Seattle%20area%20added%20a,tech%20jobs%20of%2023.3%20percent.">one of the nation's fastest growing tech hubs</a> and I am optimistic that I can be a contribution to the field after completing Epicodus.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Climate and Georgraphy</strong>. Although the winters can be quite gray, snow fall and frigid tempatures are mild in comparison to Colorado or Chicago. The summers here are a treasured secret and provide many opportunities for hiking and enjoying nature.</li>
        <li><strong>Craft Beer</strong>. A dream of mine is to one day brew my own beer. Until then, Seattle provides many lovely breweries to do research.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Bountiful Farmers Markets</h4>
        <p>The accessibility to fresh local produce is prolific. Cooking is a growing interest of mine and the availablity of different varieties of vegetables has expanded my culinary capabilities. Check out what day the Farmers Market is open in your area <a href="http://wafarmersmarkets.org/washingtonfarmersmarketdirectory/">here</a>.</p>
      <h4>Mountains and Mother Nature</h4>
        <p>Visit <a href="https://www.wta.org/">Washington Trails Association</a> to find the right hike for you  to explore the Evergreen State! Washington has three <a href="https://www.nps.gov/state/wa/index.htm">National Parks</a> to explore. I enjoy escaping the routine of every day life and admiring the breathtaking mountains, <em>volcanos</em>, glaciers, wildflowers, forests, and wildlife. <span class="fun"><br><strong>The beautiful sleeping giant, Mt. Rainier, <em>blows my mind</em> everytime I catch a peek of it.</strong></span></p>
