      <h2>Settle in Seattle</h2>
      <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e3/Seattle_Kerry_Park_Skyline.jpg" class="seattle" alt="Seattle Skyline">
      <p>After much thought, I decided to leave my beloved island of Oahu. I first backpacked through <strong>Europe</strong> and then decided to try to settle down somewhere on the <strong>Mainland</strong> <em>(contiguous United States)<em>. My first stop was Houston, Texas and it deemed to be too <strong>crowded</strong> and <strong>humid</strong> for me. The next stop was northern Colorado. It was the complete opposite of my experience in Houston. I lived on a horse ranch in a remote town, and it was <strong>cold</strong> and <strong>dry</strong>. Although there were many opportunities to enjoy two of my favorite hobbies, hiking and drinking local craft beer, my body made me <em>very</em> aware that it did not want to acclimate to Colorado's high altitude and dry climate. In result, I left Colorado and drove to <strong>Seattle</strong>.</p>
      <h3>Reasons for Relocation:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Career Change</strong>. My goal is to find a career in computer programming. I am optimistic that I can provide a great contribution to the field after completing Epicodus.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Climate and Georgraphy</strong>. From the mountains to the sea Washington provides an ideal living environment for me. The summers here are a treasured secret and provide many opportunities for hiking and enjoying nature.</li>
        <li><strong>Craft Beer</strong>. A dream of mine is to one day brew my own beer. Until then, Seattle provides many lovely breweries to conduct research until I am able to brew my own.</li>
      </ul>
